# WebSocket Training App Implementation Plan

## 1. Server WebSocket Setup
- Implement WebSocket server initialization and connection handling
- Add WebSocket client tracking (connected clients array)
- Success Criteria:
  - Server logs show successful WebSocket initialization
  - Can connect to WebSocket endpoint using a test client
  - Server detects client connections/disconnections
- Status: Completed server implementation and testing

Completed Requirements:
1. WebSocket server initialization 
   - Implemented WebSocket server on port 3003 with '/progress' path
   - Using ES modules with proper imports
   - Server successfully starts and listens for connections

2. Connection handling 
   - Added connection event listener with proper logging
   - Implemented error handling for WebSocket connections
   - Set up message handling infrastructure

3. Client tracking 
   - Created connectedClients Set to store active connections
   - Implemented client tracking on connect/disconnect
   - Added logging for total connected clients count

4. Server logging 
   - Added startup logs for both HTTP and WebSocket servers
   - Implemented connection/disconnection logging
   - Added error logging for WebSocket events

5. Connection state detection 
   - Implemented 'connection' event handling
   - Added 'close' event detection with cleanup
   - Added 'error' event handling with cleanup

## 2. Server State Management Refactor
- Move state management from HTTP endpoints to WebSocket handlers
- Implement state transition logic with timeouts
- Success Criteria:
  - State transitions work with correct timing (2s each)
  - State is properly maintained between transitions
  - Previous HTTP state management removed
- Status: Completed implementation

Completed Requirements:
1. State Management Migration 
   - Created dedicated state management functions
   - Implemented startCalculationProcess() and cancelCalculationProcess()
   - Added proper state cleanup with clearCalculation()

2. WebSocket Message Handling 
   - Added message event listener for WebSocket commands
   - Implemented action handlers for 'start' and 'cancel'
   - Added error handling for invalid messages

3. State Transitions 
   - Implemented sequential state transitions
   - Each state lasts exactly 2 seconds
   - States: STARTING -> IN_PROGRESS -> ALMOST_DONE -> SUCCESS

4. HTTP Endpoint Refactor 
   - Converted HTTP endpoints to use WebSocket handlers
   - Maintained backward compatibility
   - Added proper error responses

5. State Broadcasting 
   - Implemented broadcastState for all clients
   - Added state logging
   - Proper error handling for closed connections

## 3. WebSocket Message Protocol
- Define WebSocket message types and formats
- Implement message serialization/deserialization
- Success Criteria:
  - All message types documented
  - Test messages can be properly serialized/deserialized
  - Message format matches requirements for all states
- Status: Not Started

## 4. Server Calculation Control
- Implement start calculation WebSocket handler
- Add calculation state broadcast to all clients
- Success Criteria:
  - Calculation starts via WebSocket message
  - All connected clients receive state updates
  - State progression works (STARTING → IN_PROGRESS → ALMOST_DONE)
- Status: Not Started

## 5. Server Cancel Implementation
- Add cancel calculation WebSocket handler
- Implement proper cleanup of running calculations
- Success Criteria:
  - Can cancel running calculation
  - All timeouts properly cleared
  - CANCELED state broadcast to all clients
- Status: Not Started

## 6. Frontend WebSocket Connection
- Remove HTTP polling code
- Add WebSocket connection setup
- Implement reconnection logic
- Success Criteria:
  - WebSocket connection established on app start
  - Connection status properly managed
  - Automatic reconnection works
- Status: Not Started

## 7. Frontend Message Handlers
- Implement WebSocket message listeners
- Add state update handlers
- Success Criteria:
  - All server messages properly received
  - State updates reflect in UI
  - No console errors
- Status: Not Started

## 8. Frontend UI Updates
- Update start/cancel button handlers to use WebSocket
- Implement proper loading states
- Success Criteria:
  - Buttons trigger correct WebSocket messages
  - Loading spinner works correctly
  - UI updates match state changes
- Status: Not Started

## 9. Error Handling
- Add proper error handling for WebSocket operations
- Implement user feedback for errors
- Success Criteria:
  - Connection errors properly handled
  - User notified of connection issues
  - App gracefully handles server disconnects
- Status: Not Started

## 10. Final Integration Testing
- Test complete calculation flow
- Verify all requirements met
- Success Criteria:
  - Full calculation cycle works (start to success)
  - Cancel works at any stage
  - All timings match requirements
  - UI elements behave as specified
  - Multiple clients work simultaneously
- Status: Not Started

## Notes
- Each task must be completed and verified before moving to the next
- Status will be updated as we progress
- Issues found during implementation will be documented here
